1. Sending an empty array of assets would still transfer your funds. Maybe consider checking the length of the array?

2. minInitPrice_ can be instantiated to up to uint256(-1) (2^256 - 1)
   However in case if(newInitPrice < minInitPrice) we are setting newInitPrice = minInitPrice; and then we are casting to uint128. This means that initPrice can be less then the minInitPrice in some edge cases.
   A mitigation can be for the minInitPrice to be uint128(-1) (2^128 - 1) and then we can cast to uint128 safely.

3. Some tokens that are have some value but change their balance in a case of a real execution vs staticCall execution might bait a buy that transfers the payment amount but the received value is 0 for example. It would be more of a phishing attack if anyone can deploy a fee flow controller.

4. (INFO) Fee on transfer tokens might cause the emit of incorrect event amounts. Something to keep in mind.

5. (INFO) for gas optimization you can transfer the whole balance -1 wei to keep the slot non-zero. This will keep the gas cost constant and more predictable as well.

? what happens after period expires?

6. It seems to me that after a period expires you can get the the assets for free. If that happens anything after that point that goes to the contract can be fetched for free. Not sure if that is expected behavior.
